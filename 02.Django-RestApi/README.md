# Django Admin Template Project

The following files are created by the `django-admin startproject todobackend` command

![Image](images/startproject.png)


- top level folder (todobackend) is called `project-root`
- manage.py : performs project tasks
- internal folder is called `django-root`
- settings.py - configuration settings for the project
- urls.py - route http requests 
- wsgi.py - allows apache or nginx servers to pipe http requests into the application


For the purpose of CD, we need to change `project-root` name to `src`.
